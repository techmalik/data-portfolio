Project Name  | Description   |  Keywords
------------- | ------------- | ------------------
[Climate Change Belief Analysis](https://github.com/techmalik/Climate-Change-Belief-analysis-2207ACDS_Team_GM1)  | * Developed a machine learning model to classify tweets based on climate change sentiment. </br> * Used Logistic Regression model. * Created a streamlit app for demonstration. </br> * Hosted it on AWS EC2.</br> * Connectivity using Flask API. | Python, EDA, Modeling, Parameter tuning, deployment, Classification
[South-african Language Identification](https://github.com/techmalik/SA-Language-Identification-NLP)  | * Trained a model to classify text to one of 11 South-african languages. </br> * Used a multinomial Naive Bayes model with a 1-2 n-gram vectorizer to classify the texts. | Python, EDA, NLP, Modeling, Parameter tuning, Classification
[Spain Electricity Shortfall Challenge](https://github.com/techmalik/Team_NM4)  | * Trained a model to predict electricity the 3-hourly load shortfall. </br> * Evaluated 4 models and chose the best performing one (XGBoost). </br> * Deployed the solution on an AWS EC2 instance. </br> * Connected the solution with an API and Flask. | Python, EDA, Model Evaluation, Parameter tuning, Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.
[GADS 2020 Phase II Project Exercises: Qwiklabs Completed](https://github.com/techmalik/GADS-2020-PhaseII-ProjectExercises)  | * Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Project exercises. </br> * Configured Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, App Engine, GKE, Deployment Manager, BigQuery, VPC, Cloud IAM, HTTP Load Balancer with Autoscaling, VPN. | Cloud, GCP, Configurations, Qwiklabs.
[Profitable App Profiles for the App Store & Google Play Markets](https://github.com/techmalik/ProfitabilityAppProfiles)  | * The goal for this project is to analyze data to help developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users. </br> * Used Jupyter notebook for the analysis. | Python, EDA, Data manipulation.
[Analysis of Helicopter Escapes!](https://github.com/techmalik/PrisonBreak)  | * Using Python, I analyzed from a dataset - helicopter prison breaks. | Python, EDA, Data manipulation, visualization.
[Exploring COVID deaths and Vaccination](https://github.com/techmalik/SQLPortfolio)  | * Using SQL, explored covid deaths and vaccination around the globe. </br> * Joined tables and created views | SQL, JOINS, CREATE View.
[Cleaning Nashville Housing data in SQL Queries](https://github.com/techmalik/NashvilleHousing)  | * Cleaned the Nashville Housing dataset using SQL queries | SQL, UPDATE, ALTER TABLE, CTE, JOIN.
[Analyzing CIA Factbook Data Using SQL](https://github.com/techmalik/CIAFactBookSQL)  | * Performed basic analysis on the CIA Factbook using SQL on Jupyter Notebook. </br> * Analysis include querying countries with min/max population or population growth. | SQL, Python, EDA.
